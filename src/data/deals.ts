    blurb:
      "The Gel-Kayano is Asics' flagship stability shoe, the one runners with flat feet or tired knees quietly swear by, and Altitude Sports has the current version 32 on clearance at $145.19, down from $219.99, simply because the Kayano 33 just landed. Nothing about the shoe changed overnight because a new model number arrived. Sign up for a free Altitude Sports account and another 5 percent comes off at checkout, bringing it to $137.93. If you run, walk a lot, or stand all day, this is a genuine flagship shoe at a mid-tier price. One honest note so you go in clear eyed: clearance means sizes and colours are already thinning out and a few widths are gone, so grab your size sooner rather than later, and buy it because you need good shoes, not because the percent-off looks big.",

    price: "$148",
    blurb:
      "If you already live in the Milwaukee M12 cordless world, this is the kind of quiet restock deal worth jumping on. Home Depot has the M12 REDLITHIUM HIGH OUTPUT XC 5.0 Ah battery two-pack, charger included, for $148. A single one of these high-output batteries on its own usually runs close to what this whole kit costs, so getting two of them plus a charger at this price is the real draw, and they power the entire M12 lineup of 125-plus tools. One honest caveat so nobody buys wrong: this is batteries and a charger, not a tool, and it only makes sense if you are already on M12 or about to be. If you have never owned a Milwaukee tool, start with an actual tool kit instead. Stock has moved around by region through this sale, so make sure your local store shows it in stock before you drive over.",

Buy these one at a time at an outdoor shop and you are usually looking at well over a hundred each, so getting a matched pair for two hundred is the real draw here, perfect for the cottage, the campsite, or a couple of chairs you can toss in the trunk and forget about. One honest note so you go in clear eyed: this is $40 off Costco's own price rather than some blowout, so think of it as a fair deal on a genuinely good chair, not a fire sale. It is online only and the offer runs through July 5.",

It is the proper kind with an 8mm polycarbonate roof and built in netting, so you get real shade that stands up to sun and rain and a screen to keep the bugs out on summer evenings, and at this price it undercuts most of what you will find elsewhere by a wide margin. Two honest notes before you commit. This is a last chance clearance item, which means once the stock is gone it is gone and there is no set end date, so it can disappear quietly. And it is a big build that needs a flat spot and proper anchoring, so plan for an afternoon of assembly and a helper or two.",

    blurb:
      "If you are driving an older car that never came with CarPlay, a portable screen like this is a genuinely productive little buy that drags your dashboard into the modern era for about a hundred dollars. It runs wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on a 9.26 inch display, supports a backup camera, and handles maps, music, and hands free calls without you ever touching your phone. It lists at $138.99 with a 28% off coupon you tick at checkout, which brings it down to roughly $100. One honest catch so you buy with eyes open: this is an off brand unit from a third party seller rather than a name you will recognize, and the price hinges entirely on that checkout coupon, so make sure the 28% is actually showing before you pay. It is also a screen that mounts on your dash, not a built in head unit.",

The DEWALT 20V MAX is the one most people land on, and Prime Day has it at $142 down from $198.70. It tops up car tires quickly, handles bikes and sports balls, and runs off the same 20V batteries as the rest of the DEWALT lineup. One honest catch so you buy with eyes open: this is the tool only, no battery or charger in the box, so it is a no brainer if you already own DEWALT 20V gear and a pricier proposition if you are starting from scratch.

It is the DeLorean time machine in LEGO form, 357 pieces, with Doc Brown and Marty minifigures and two build modes. Aimed at ages nine and up, and honestly just as fun for the grown up who grew up on the movies. Two honest notes: it is a Prime Day price so you need a Prime membership to grab it, and Amazon is showing it more than half claimed already, so it may sell out before the sale ends June 26.",

      "Apple almost never marks down the Apple Watch, so a real Prime Day cut across the whole lineup is worth a look. The Series 11 in 46mm GPS is down to $414 from $589, about 30% off, and the cheaper SE 3 and the rugged Ultra 3 are discounted too. It is the upgrade most people actually feel day to day: a bigger always-on screen, proper sleep and heart tracking, and the watchOS bits that just work with an iPhone. Two honest notes so you pick the right one. This price is the GPS model, the cellular version costs more and only earns its keep if you want to leave your phone behind on runs. And if you mostly want notifications and fitness basics, the SE 3 does the job for a good bit less. Sale runs through Prime Day, which wraps June 26.",

The picture is the real draw here, with the perfect inky blacks and rich contrast that make sports and movies look special, and right now LG is tossing in six months of TSN on top. Two honest notes before you jump. This price has dipped here once or twice before, so think of it as a strong deal rather than a once ever one. And OLED panels are a bit of a lottery, so I would add Costco's inexpensive extended warranty for real peace of mind, and their return policy has your back if anything ever goes sideways.

One honest heads up so you buy with eyes open: this is a basic 173cc engine, happiest on dry grass that you keep up with weekly. Let the lawn get tall or soggy and it can bog down, so it is not the one for a big or rough property.
