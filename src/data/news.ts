      "This is a nice little earn if you already buy the odd thing before a flight. Announced June 30, the tie-up between Aeroplan and Club Avolta, the loyalty program behind airport retailers like Hudson and Dufry duty-free, lets you collect 1 Aeroplan point for every $2 you spend in-store or through Reserve & Collect. You have to link your Aeroplan and Club Avolta accounts in the Club Avolta app first, or none of it tracks. It is live now at Canadian airports including Toronto Pearson, Vancouver, Calgary, and Billy Bishop, plus a handful of US hubs like LAX, San Francisco, and Chicago, with HMSHost restaurants set to join for dining points by the end of the year and the full network reaching about 1,900 locations. Be honest with yourself here though: half a point per dollar is a thin return, and airport shops carry a captive-audience markup, so this is worth grabbing on a water and a magazine you were buying anyway, not a reason to browse the duty-free.",

Air Canada Vacations is giving Aeroplan members 5,000 bonus points each on select Flight and Hotel packages to the Texas city, for bookings made from June 29 through July 26 and travel between July 1 and October 31. The catch is a seven-night minimum stay, so it really only pays off if you were planning a proper week there rather than a quick weekend away. If that fits your summer, it is a tidy little top-up on a trip you were buying anyway, but we would not build a vacation around 5,000 points.",

You will need to scan your Triangle Rewards card or a linked cardless method at the pump, or pay with a Triangle credit card, for it to register. It is not life-changing money, but if you were filling up anyway it adds up nicely across the week, especially when more than one driver in the household is pumping gas.",

The habit to build is clicking through the eStore first and easing off any ad blockers, since that tracking is what triggers the bonus. We would not buy bedding you do not actually need just to chase points, but if you were going to replace yours anyway, this is a tidy way to pad your Aeroplan balance toward the next trip.",

Those are serious spend targets, so this really suits a household that already runs big everyday expenses through one card rather than someone stretching to hit them. Applications close July 28, and the annual fee and perks are worth weighing against how often you actually fly Air Canada.",
