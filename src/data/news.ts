    body:
      "This one is easy to like because it asks almost nothing of you. Register on the Aeroplan site, then click through the Aeroplan eStore before you shop Amazon between now and June 26, and you are entered. Ten winners each take home a million points. You need an Amazon Prime membership to play, and there is a no-purchase mail-in option if you would rather not buy anything. Even outside the contest, going through the eStore quietly stacks extra Aeroplan points on purchases you were making anyway, with up to 10 times the points on eligible categories during Prime Day.",

    body:
      "Good news for anyone sitting on VIPorter points. Porter has cut the fee on award bookings from $40 to $20 per person each way, and it shows up now as an air transportation charge rather than a peak surcharge. One honest caveat so you are not surprised at checkout: the total taxes and fees dropped by less than the full $20, because some airport improvement fees went up at the same time. Still, a real move in the right direction.",

      "If you have had your eye on an Asiana redemption, the clock is now ticking. Aeroplan members can keep earning miles on Asiana flights until October 15, and can book or fly Asiana award seats up to December 16. After that Asiana merges into Korean Air, which is not a Star Alliance carrier, so the easy Aeroplan access goes away. Worth a look if Seoul or an onward Asia route is on your list. Our sweet-spots guide can help you find the seats worth chasing.",
