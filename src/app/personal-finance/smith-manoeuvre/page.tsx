const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "Is the Smith Manoeuvre legal in Canada?",
    a: "Yes. It relies on a long-standing rule in the Income Tax Act that makes interest deductible when the borrowed money is used to earn income from a business or property. You are not exploiting a loophole, you are borrowing to invest in income-producing assets and deducting that interest, which the CRA has always allowed. The catch is traceability, so you need a clean, unbroken paper trail from the borrowed dollars to the investments.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much equity do I need to start the Smith Manoeuvre?",
    a: "You generally need at least 20 percent equity in your home. A readvanceable line of credit cannot push your total borrowing above 80 percent of the home's value, so that 20 percent cushion is what makes room for the strategy. Beyond the equity, you also want stable cash flow and a long time horizon before you begin.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a special mortgage for the Smith Manoeuvre?",
    a: "Yes, you need a readvanceable mortgage, which pairs a normal amortizing mortgage with a line of credit that grows automatically as you pay down principal. Common Canadian options include the Scotia STEP, the National Bank All-in-One, Manulife One, the RBC Homeline Plan, and MCAP Fusion. Without a readvanceable product, the freed-up room does not appear on its own and the loop does not run.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if my leveraged investments lose money?",
    a: "You still owe the full line-of-credit balance and the interest on it, even if the portfolio is worth less than the loan. A downturn early on is the hardest case, because you can end up owing more than the investments are worth. This is why the strategy suits people with staying power, reliable cash flow, and a long horizon who can ride a dip out rather than sell at the bottom.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I do the Smith Manoeuvre before maxing my TFSA and RRSP?",
    a: "Usually not. For most families it is worth filling your TFSA and RRSP room first, since those give you tax advantages without any leverage. The Smith Manoeuvre tends to make the most sense once those easy, unleveraged shelters are already working for you and you still have appetite for more.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a return-of-capital distribution and why does it matter?",
    a: "Some funds pay distributions that are partly a return of your own capital rather than income. That matters because return of capital can slowly erode how much of your interest stays deductible. The cleanest move is to put any return of capital back against the investment loan so your deduction stays intact.",

            If you own a home in Canada, the Smith Manoeuvre is one of the most powerful, and most
            misunderstood, financial strategies available to you. Done patiently and properly, it turns the
            interest on your mortgage into a tax deduction and quietly builds an investment portfolio while you
            pay your house off. Done carelessly, it adds leverage and paperwork you do not want. This guide
            walks through all of it, the upside and the cautions, so you can decide with clear eyes.

            <div className="cap">The short answer</div>
            <p style={{ margin: 0 }} className="sub">The Smith Manoeuvre is a way for Canadian homeowners to make their mortgage interest tax-deductible. Using a readvanceable mortgage, every dollar of principal you pay down frees an equal dollar of line-of-credit room, which you borrow and invest in income-producing assets so its interest becomes deductible. You reinvest each tax refund into the mortgage to speed things up, and over the years your non-deductible mortgage is replaced by a deductible investment loan plus a portfolio. It is genuine leverage though, so it needs at least 20 percent home equity, stable cash flow, a long horizon, and clean records to work.</p>

          {/* WHAT */}
          <div id="what" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>What is the Smith Manoeuvre, actually?</div>
          <p>
            In Canada, the interest you pay on your home mortgage is not tax-deductible. The interest you pay
            on money you borrow to earn investment income is. The Smith Manoeuvre, named after Canadian
            financial planner Fraser Smith, is simply a disciplined way to convert the first kind of debt into
            the second kind over time, without borrowing any new money from your own pocket.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mechanics rest on a special kind of mortgage called a readvanceable mortgage. It pairs a normal
            amortizing mortgage with a line of credit, and every dollar of principal you pay down frees up an
            equal dollar of room on that line of credit. You then borrow that freed-up room and invest it. Because
            the borrowed money is being used to earn income, its interest becomes deductible. You claim the
            deduction, receive a tax refund, and use that refund to pay down your mortgage a little faster, which
            frees up a little more room, and around it goes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, your non-deductible mortgage shrinks while your deductible investment loan grows to
            replace it. By the time the mortgage is gone, you are left with an investment portfolio and a loan
            whose interest the government helps you carry. That is the whole idea in one breath.
          </p>

          {/* WHY */}
          <div id="why" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>Why does it work?</div>
          <p>
            The strategy leans on one long-standing rule in the Income Tax Act. Interest is deductible when the
            borrowed money is used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property. A regular
            mortgage on the home you live in fails that test, because the purpose is shelter, not income. A line
            of credit you draw on to buy income-producing investments passes it.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the Smith Manoeuvre does not invent a loophole. It re-routes money you were already going to pay
            toward your mortgage so that, dollar for dollar, your debt slowly moves from the non-deductible side
            of the ledger to the deductible side. The two extra engines that make it more than a tax trick are
            the investment growth on the money you put to work, and the compounding effect of reinvesting your
            tax refunds back into the mortgage.
          </p>

          {/* NEED */}
          <div id="need" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>What do you need before you start?</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>A readvanceable mortgage.</strong> This is the non-negotiable tool. Common ones in Canada include the Scotia STEP, the National Bank All-in-One, Manulife One, the RBC Homeline Plan, and MCAP Fusion. They combine a mortgage with a line of credit that grows automatically as you pay principal.</li>
            <li><strong>Home equity.</strong> You generally need at least 20 percent equity, because a readvanceable line of credit cannot push your total borrowing above 80 percent of the home&apos;s value.</li>
            <li><strong>Stable cash flow.</strong> You will be carrying line-of-credit interest every month. Comfortable, reliable income makes this far less stressful.</li>
            <li><strong>A long time horizon and a steady temperament.</strong> This is a strategy measured in years, sometimes the full length of your amortization. You also need to be able to watch a leveraged portfolio dip without panicking.</li>
            <li><strong>A plan for the investments.</strong> Broad, low-cost, income-producing investments are the usual fit. Decide your approach before the first dollar goes in.</li>

            <div className="accbody">

          {/* CLEAN */}
          <div id="clean" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>How do you keep the CRA happy?</div>
          <p>
            The deduction is the engine, so protecting it matters more than any clever optimization. The CRA
            cares about traceability, meaning a clean, unbroken line from borrowed dollars to income-producing
            investments. A few habits keep you on solid ground.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep the investment line of credit completely separate.</strong> Never pay for groceries, vacations, or anything personal from it. One dedicated sub-account, used only for investing, keeps the trail spotless.</li>
            <li><strong>Send borrowed money straight to investments.</strong> Avoid parking it in a personal chequing account along the way, which can muddy the purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Mind return-of-capital distributions.</strong> Some funds pay distributions that are partly a return of your own capital rather than income. If you receive return of capital, the cleanest move is to put it back against the investment loan, otherwise you can slowly erode how much of the interest stays deductible.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not break the chain.</strong> If you sell an investment, the proceeds should generally go back toward the investment loan or into new eligible investments, not toward personal spending.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep good records and consider a professional.</strong> A tidy spreadsheet of every draw and every investment, plus an accountant who understands the strategy, is cheap insurance for a deduction you will rely on for years.</li>
          </ul>

          {/* RISKS */}
          <div id="risks" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>What are the risks, honestly?</div>
          <p>
            This part deserves your full attention, because the Smith Manoeuvre is leverage, and leverage is a
            tool that works in both directions. None of the following should scare you off if the strategy fits
            your life, but you should walk in knowing them.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Leverage magnifies losses, not just gains.</strong> You are investing borrowed money. A market downturn, especially early on, can leave you owing on a portfolio worth less than the loan. You need the staying power to ride that out.</li>
            <li><strong>Your borrowing cost can rise.</strong> The line of credit is usually a variable, prime-linked rate. When rates climb, your interest cost climbs, and your investments have to clear a higher bar to come out ahead.</li>
            <li><strong>It demands real cash flow.</strong> The interest is due every month regardless of how your investments are doing. A job loss or a rate spike at the wrong time can turn a smart strategy into a stressful one.</li>
            <li><strong>It rewards discipline and punishes sloppiness.</strong> The tax benefit depends on clean records. Commingling funds or breaking the trail can cost you the deduction that makes the whole thing worthwhile.</li>
            <li><strong>It is a long commitment.</strong> The math works over many years. If you might need to unwind it soon, or sell the house, the picture changes and the costs can outweigh the benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>It tests your nerves.</strong> Watching a leveraged portfolio fall is harder than watching an ordinary one fall. Be honest with yourself about how you handle volatility.</li>
          </ul>

          {/* WHO */}
          <div id="who" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>Is it for you?</div>
          <p>
            The Smith Manoeuvre tends to suit homeowners with stable income, a long time horizon, a healthy
            emergency fund, a genuine tolerance for risk, and the patience to keep clean records year after
            year. If that sounds like you, and your TFSA and RRSP are already working hard, it can be a
            remarkable way to make your largest debt do double duty.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is probably not the right move if your cash flow is tight, if you are close to retirement or a
            short time horizon, if market swings keep you up at night, or if you do not yet have a cushion for
            life&apos;s surprises. There is no shame in deciding the simpler path is the better one for your
            family. The best strategy is always the one you can actually stick with.
