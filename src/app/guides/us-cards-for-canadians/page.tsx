const FAQ = [
  {
    q: 'Can a Canadian get a US credit card?',
    a: 'Yes. The most reliable first step is Amex Global Transfer, which lets you use an existing Canadian Amex card to get approved for a US Amex with no US credit history and no ITIN. For most other issuers, like Chase, Citi, and Capital One, you also need a US mailing address, a US bank account, an ITIN, and several months of US credit history.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you need an ITIN to get US credit cards?',
    a: 'Not for your first Amex through Global Transfer, but you do for almost everyone else. Chase, Citi, Capital One, and Bank of America all want an ITIN, which is the tax ID the IRS issues to people who are not eligible for a Social Security Number. That is why the usual plan is to get the Amex card first and apply for the ITIN in parallel.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does it cost to get an ITIN?',
    a: 'The do-it-yourself route costs under $10. You file a 1040-NR return declaring a small amount of self-declared US-source gambling income, around $75 to $100, which creates a valid reason to need an ITIN and leaves you owing about $9 in tax. If you would rather not touch IRS forms, a specialist tax service handles the whole thing for roughly $150 to $300.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does the whole process take?',
    a: 'Getting your first Amex takes about 2 to 4 weeks, and the ITIN takes about 7 weeks to process, or 9 to 11 weeks if you apply during tax season (mid-January to late April) or from outside the US. Because those run in parallel, your credit is already building while the IRS works. Most people reach the point where Chase will approve them around 12 to 18 months after their first US card.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why do you have to check the commercial-address flag?',
    a: 'Look up your US address in the USPS tool and check the Commercial Mail Receiving Agency flag. It must read N. If it shows Y, issuers like Chase may flag and reject your applications. Some mail forwarding addresses are flagged as commercial, so always verify before you sign up.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you use US cards for spending in Canada?',
    a: 'Yes. Most premium US cards have no foreign transaction fee, so you can use them for everyday Canadian purchases and earn US points without the usual 2.5 percent surcharge. Just keep the double currency conversion in mind, and pay your bills through an FX service like Wise, VBCE, or Knightsbridge FX rather than your bank\'s exchange rate.',

            <div className="cap">Short answer</div>
            Yes, a Canadian can get US credit cards. You need a US mailing address, a US bank account, and a US credit history, plus an ITIN for most issuers. The usual path is to get your first US Amex through Amex Global Transfer (no ITIN or US credit needed), apply for an ITIN in parallel, build a few months of history, then move on to Chase and other banks. Expect the full sequence to reach Chase to take roughly 12 to 18 months.

          {/* WHY */}
          <div id="why" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>Why do Canadians get US credit cards?</div>
          <p>
            If you care about travel rewards, the US credit card market is a different league. The welcome
            bonuses are bigger, there are far more transfer partners, and some cards hand you hotel elite
            status just for being a cardholder. Here is the short version of why it is worth the effort.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bigger welcome bonuses.</strong> A US Amex Platinum routinely offers 150k or more Membership Rewards points. The Canadian version usually sits around 70k to 80k.</li>
            <li><strong>More transfer partners.</strong> Amex US has roughly twice the airline partners that Amex Canada does, which means many more sweet spots to find.</li>
            <li><strong>Status from a card.</strong> The Hilton Aspire gives you Hilton Diamond and the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant gives you Platinum, with no nights required.</li>
            <li><strong>No foreign transaction fees.</strong> Most premium US cards waive FX fees, so you can even use them for Canadian spending without the usual 2.5 percent surcharge.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="sub">
            The catch is the upfront work. You need a US address, you build credit from zero, and you go
            through the ITIN process with the IRS. None of it is hard on its own. We will take the steps in
            an order that lets you start earning early while the slower pieces process in the background.

            {/* Step 1 */}
            <div id="step-1" className="step" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>

              <div className="st">Get a US mailing address</div>
              <div className="stm">cost: about $70 to $90 USD per year</div>
              <p>
                Before anything else you need a US residential address. This is where your cards, statements,
                and IRS letters will arrive. You have two good options.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Option A, a mail forwarding service.</strong> Providers like 24/7 Parcel, US Global Mail, and Traveling Mailbox give you a real street address (not a PO box) and scan or forward your mail. Budget $70 to $90 USD per year.</p>
              <p><strong>Option B, a friend or family member in the US.</strong> If someone is willing to receive your mail, this is the cheapest route. Just make sure they are comfortable with the occasional IRS letter and card envelope.</p>
              <div className="cd-note red">
                <div className="cap">Important check</div>
                Look your address up in the USPS tool and check the Commercial Mail Receiving Agency flag. It must read <span className="fld">N</span>. If it shows <span className="fld">Y</span>, issuers like Chase may flag and reject your applications. Some forwarding addresses are flagged as commercial, so always verify before you sign up.
              </div>
            </div>

            {/* Step 2 */}
            <div id="step-2" className="step" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>

              <p>
                A US bank account does two jobs for you. It lets you pay your card bills in US dollars, and it
                gives you a statement with a US address that issuers accept as proof. The easiest path is a
                Canadian bank with a US arm.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>CIBC US.</strong> The most popular choice. No monthly fee on the Smart Account, and you can open it online from Canada.</li>
                <li><strong>TD Bank.</strong> Convenient if you already bank with TD in Canada, with branches across the US east coast.</li>
                <li><strong>BMO.</strong> BMO&apos;s US arm, with an easy cross-border setup.</li>
                <li><strong>RBC Bank.</strong> RBC&apos;s US presence, mainly in the southeast.</li>
              </ul>
              <div className="cd-note">
                <div className="cap">Tip</div>
                Set your US mailing address as the primary address on this account. You will use these statements as proof of address when you apply for cards.

            {/* Step 3 */}

              <p>
                This is the clever part. Amex Global Transfer lets you use your existing Canadian Amex
                relationship to get approved for a US Amex card, with no US credit history and no ITIN
                required yet. It is the single best on-ramp Canadians have.
              </p>
              <h4>What you need</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>An existing Canadian Amex card, open for at least 3 months</li>
                <li>Your US mailing address</li>
                <li>Your US bank account</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>How to apply</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Online.</strong> Apply on the US Amex site and check the box that says you hold an Amex card from another country, then enter your Canadian card details.</li>
                <li><strong>By phone.</strong> Call the Amex Global Transfer line and they will walk you through it.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You may be asked to upload your passport and a bank statement showing your US address. That is normal, so just have them ready.</p>
              <div className="cd-note red">
                <div className="cap">Start personal, not business</div>
                Your first card must be a personal card. Business cards do not build personal credit history in the US, and the whole point of this first card is to open your credit file with the bureaus.
              </div>
              <p>Popular starter cards are the <Link href="/cards?country=US" className="lnk">Amex Hilton Honors</Link> (no annual fee, a great long-term keeper) and the <Link href="/cards?country=US" className="lnk">Amex Gold</Link> (strong everyday earning).</p>
              <div className="cd-note">
                <div className="cap">Choose for the long run</div>
                Your first US card becomes the oldest account on your US credit report, and account age helps your score for years. A no-fee card like the Hilton Honors is a common pick for exactly this reason.
              </div>

            {/* Step 4: ITIN */}
            <div id="step-4" className="step" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>
              <div className="num">4</div>
              <div className="st">Apply for an ITIN</div>
              <div className="stm">timeline: about 7 weeks, or 9 to 11 weeks if you apply during tax season (mid-January to late April) or from outside the US</div>
              <p>
                An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a tax ID the IRS issues to people who
                are not eligible for a Social Security Number. You need one to apply for cards from Chase,
                Citi, Capital One, Bank of America, and most issuers other than Amex.
              </p>
              <h4>Method 1: use a tax service (easiest)</h4>
              <p>
                Services that specialize in this handle the whole thing for roughly $150 to $300. They
                prepare your W-7 and file a 1040-NR return for you. This is the hands-off option if you would
                rather not touch IRS forms.
              </p>
              <h4>Method 2: do it yourself (about $10)</h4>
              <div className="cd-note">
                <div className="cap">The DIY path</div>
                The DIY route is more approachable than it looks and costs under $10. You file a 1040-NR
                return declaring a small amount of US-source gambling income, around $75 to $100, which you
                self-declare with no proof required. That creates a valid reason to need an ITIN, and you end
                up owing about $9 in tax.
              </div>
              <p>
                You will fill out Form W-7 (the ITIN application), Form 1040-NR (the non-resident return),
                Schedule 1, and Schedule OI. Have your Canadian SIN handy along with a list of any dates you
                were physically in the US during the tax year.

                <li>Any late penalty caps at 100 percent of the tax owed, so about $9 at most plus a little interest. There is no need to stress about timing.</li>
                <li>Processing takes about 7 weeks, or 9 to 11 weeks if you apply during tax season (mid-January to late April) or from outside the US, after which you receive a letter with your nine-digit ITIN.</li>
                <li>As soon as it arrives, link it to your Amex US account.</li>
                <li>An ITIN expires if it is not used on a return for three years, so file periodically to keep it active. Lost the letter? Call <span className="fld">267-941-1000</span> with your name, address, and birthdate.</li>

                This is exactly why we got the Amex card first. Your credit is already building through Global Transfer while your ITIN works its way through the IRS in parallel.

                Now comes the patient part. Your first Amex is reporting to the US bureaus, and you want enough
                history before other issuers will say yes. A few habits make a real difference here.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Add one or two more Amex personal cards in the first 3 to 6 months. Each one adds depth to your file.</li>
                <li>Amex business cards do not count toward Chase&apos;s 5/24 rule, so you can pick up a Business Platinum or Business Gold for the bonuses without hurting later Chase applications.</li>
                <li>Keep utilization around 5 to 10 percent across your cards. Low utilization signals that you handle credit well.</li>
                <li>If you can visit a US branch, open a Chase checking account. A banking relationship meaningfully helps your approval odds down the road.</li>

              <div className="cd-note red">
                <div className="cap">Do this the day your ITIN arrives</div>
                Call Amex and have them link your ITIN to every US account you hold. This ties your credit history to your ITIN in the bureau files. Skip it, and Chase and others may not be able to pull your credit.

                Chase is the goal for most people. Ultimate Rewards points are wonderfully flexible and the
                co-branded hotel cards are best in class. Chase is also the pickiest issuer, so it pays to be
                ready before you apply.
              </p>
              <h4>What Chase looks for</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>At least 12 to 18 months of US credit history</li>
                <li>A score above roughly 700, which you can track on Credit Karma US</li>
                <li>Ideally a Chase banking relationship</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>The 5/24 rule</h4>
              <p>
                Chase will decline you automatically if you have opened five or more personal cards across all
                issuers in the past 24 months. That is the whole reason we leaned on Amex business cards
                earlier, since those do not count toward 5/24.
              </p>
              <p>
                Good first Chase cards are the <Link href="/cards?country=US" className="lnk">Sapphire Preferred</Link> (a great starter), the <Link href="/cards?country=US" className="lnk">Ink Business Preferred</Link> (does not count toward 5/24), and the <Link href="/cards?country=US" className="lnk">Chase Aeroplan card</Link> (handy for Canadians).
              </p>
              <div className="cd-note">
                <div className="cap">Tip</div>
                If you can get to a US Chase branch, apply in person. Chase sometimes needs document verification for applicants without an SSN, and being in branch makes that much smoother.
              </div>

            {/* Step 7 */}

              <div className="st">Expand to other issuers</div>
              <div className="stm">timeline: 18 months and beyond</div>
              <p>Once Chase is on board and your history is solid, the rest of the market opens up.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Capital One.</strong> Usually wants around three years of history, with a strict limit of one application every six months. The Venture X makes it worthwhile.</li>
                <li><strong>Citi.</strong> The Strata Premier is excellent, and ThankYou points transfer to a strong set of airlines including Air Canada Aeroplan.</li>
                <li><strong>Bank of America.</strong> The Alaska Airlines card is a long-time favourite. Apply in branch or by phone if you are using an ITIN, since their online system does not always handle ITINs well.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                From here it is about steady habits. Pay in full every month, keep your accounts open, and
                space out applications. A mature profile earns you better approvals and higher limits over time.

          {/* MANAGING */}
          <div id="managing" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>How do you manage US cards from Canada?</div>
          <h4>Paying your bills</h4>
          <p>Skip your bank&apos;s exchange rate, since you will lose 2 to 2.5 percent on every transfer. Use a dedicated FX service like Wise, VBCE, or Knightsbridge FX instead. They typically run about 1 percent above the spot rate, which adds up to real savings over a year.</p>
          <h4>Using US cards in Canada</h4>
          <p>Here is a nice perk. Most US premium cards have no foreign transaction fee, so you can use them for everyday Canadian spending and earn US points without the 2.5 percent surcharge you would pay abroad on a Canadian card. Just keep the double conversion in mind.</p>
          <h4>Two-player mode</h4>
          <p>If you have a spouse or partner, set them up alongside you. Two players means double the welcome bonuses, double the points, and the ability to pool points between accounts. It is the single biggest force multiplier in this hobby.</p>

          {/* MISTAKES */}
          <div id="mistakes" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>What mistakes should you avoid?</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Getting too many cards too fast.</strong> Five or more personal cards in 24 months locks you out of Chase. Plan your sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Forgetting to link your ITIN to existing Amex accounts.</strong> Without it, your history may be invisible to other issuers. Call Amex the day your ITIN arrives.</li>
            <li><strong>Paying bills at bank FX rates.</strong> That 2 to 2.5 percent spread is pure waste. Use Wise, VBCE, or Knightsbridge FX.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancelling your oldest US card.</strong> It anchors your credit history. Downgrade it to a no-fee version if you must, but keep it open.</li>
            <li><strong>Not checking the commercial-address flag.</strong> Issuers can reject you if your address shows as a Commercial Mail Receiving Agency on USPS.</li>
            <li><strong>Starting with a business card.</strong> Business cards do not report to personal bureaus, so your first card has to be personal.</li>
