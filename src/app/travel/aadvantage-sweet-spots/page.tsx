const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "Should I use AAdvantage miles on American flights or partner airlines?",
    a: "Point them at partners almost every time. American's own flights are priced dynamically, so the mile cost tracks the cash fare and can balloon on busy dates. Partner airlines are priced from a fixed, region-based award chart that has barely moved in years, which is where the value lives.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many AAdvantage miles is business class to Europe?",
    a: "A one-way business class seat between North America and Europe on a partner runs about 57,500 miles, for a lie-flat cabin that routinely sells for several thousand dollars in cash. Economy on the same chart starts around 22,500 miles one-way off-peak, and first class, where it exists, is about 85,000. Lean on partners like Finnair or Iberia for the metal.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does AAdvantage charge fuel surcharges on partner awards?",
    a: "On most partner awards, no. You generally pay only genuine taxes and airport fees, which on a route like the US to Doha can be under fifty dollars. The clear exception is British Airways and Iberia, where American does pass surcharges through, and on British Airways long-haul those fees can run well past several hundred dollars each way.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I book AAdvantage partner awards online?",
    a: "Most oneworld partner awards can be searched and booked right on aa.com, including British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Qantas and Royal Air Maroc. The notable exception is Etihad, which is not a oneworld member, so its space often does not appear online and usually has to be booked by calling American. Etihad also typically releases premium partner award space only within about 30 days of departure, so a booking made further ahead usually needs Etihad Guest miles instead.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many AAdvantage miles do I need for Qatar Qsuite?",
    a: "Business class on partners like Etihad or Qatar Airways is about 70,000 miles one-way to the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, with first class around 100,000. Qatar's Qsuite booked this way is one of the marquee redemptions in the hobby, with taxes that are often under fifty dollars. Nonstop space out of the US can be scarce, but pairing a domestic American flight with the long-haul partner leg tends to show up more readily at the same rate. Note that Etihad typically releases premium partner award space only within about 30 days of departure, so a long-lead Etihad booking usually needs Etihad Guest miles rather than AAdvantage.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is transferring RBC Avion to AAdvantage worth the haircut?",
    a: "Only for high-value redemptions. Avion moves at roughly 1 Avion to 0.7 miles, so it takes about 100,000 Avion points to land 70,000 AAdvantage miles. Spent on a Qatar Qsuite seat worth several thousand dollars in cash, that is an excellent trade. Spent on a cheap economy seat you could have bought outright, the haircut makes it a poor one.",

          <p className="lede">
            In the companion guide we walked through moving RBC Avion points into American Airlines AAdvantage, and
            the obvious next question is what to actually do with those miles once they land. AAdvantage is a quietly
            excellent program for Canadians, but only if you point it at the right redemptions. Spend your miles on
            American&apos;s own flights and you are at the mercy of dynamic pricing. Spend them on partner airlines and
            you tap a fixed award chart that has barely moved in years, with some of the best premium cabin value
            anywhere. Here is where AAdvantage pays off, and how to book it without nasty surprises.

            <div className="cap">The short answer</div>
            <p style={{ margin: 0 }} className="sub">
              AAdvantage miles are best spent on partner airlines, not American&apos;s own flights. American metal is
              priced dynamically and floats with the cash fare, while partners follow a fixed award chart that has barely
              moved in years. The standout redemptions are business class to Europe around 57,500 miles, Japan Airlines
              around 60,000, and Qatar Qsuite or Etihad business around 70,000, all with low surcharges as long as you
              avoid British Airways and Iberia metal.

          {/* HOW */}
          <div id="how" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>How does AAdvantage price flights?</div>
          <p>
            AAdvantage runs two completely different pricing systems, and knowing which one you are looking at decides
            whether a redemption is brilliant or terrible. Flights operated by American Airlines itself are priced
            dynamically. The mile cost tracks the cash fare, so a pricey route on a busy weekend can balloon with no
            real ceiling. The cheapest of these are labelled Web Specials, and on a quiet route they can be a genuine
            bargain, but you cannot count on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flights operated by partner airlines are different. They are priced from a fixed, region-based award chart
            that American has left largely untouched for years. That chart is the real reason to hold AAdvantage miles
            as a Canadian. The price holds steady even when cash fares are sky high, and because American does not pass
            along most fuel surcharges, the all-in cost stays low. The figures below are the standard partner-chart
            levels and they are approximate, so always confirm the live price when you search.
          </p>
          <div className="cd-note">
            <div className="cap">The one rule to remember</div>
            <p style={{ margin: 0 }} className="sub">
              On American metal, miles behave like cash and the price floats. On partner airlines, miles follow a fixed
              chart and behave like a coupon. The partner chart is where the value lives, so that is where to hunt.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* SPOTS */}
          <div id="spots" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>Where are the sweet spots?</div>

          <h4>Short hops within North America</h4>
          <p>
            For partner flights wholly within North America, economy on the AAdvantage chart starts around 7,500 miles
            one-way off-peak, stepping up to about 12,500 on peak dates. On a short, expensive route that often beats
            the cash fare comfortably, and it is a tidy way to spend a smaller balance. American&apos;s own short hops
            can sometimes price even lower as a Web Special, so it is worth checking both before you book.
          </p>

          <h4>Business class to Europe on a partner</h4>
          <p>
            This is the redemption AAdvantage is quietly famous for. A one-way business class seat between North America
            and Europe on a partner runs about 57,500 miles, for a lie-flat cabin that routinely sells for several
            thousand dollars in cash. Lean on partners like Finnair or Iberia for the metal, and you can pay a fraction
            of the cash price in points. Economy on the same chart starts around 22,500 miles one-way off-peak, and
            first class, where it exists, is about 85,000.
          </p>

          <h4>Japan on Japan Airlines</h4>
          <p>
            Japan Airlines is one of the best uses of AAdvantage miles going. Business class between North America and
            Japan is about 60,000 miles one-way, and first class, when you can find it, is roughly 80,000. JAL&apos;s
            premium cabins are excellent and the airline does not levy fuel surcharges, so you mostly pay miles plus
            modest taxes. The catch is that JAL releases its best award space in patterns, so flexibility and a little
            patience help a lot.
          </p>

          <h4>Etihad and Qatar to the Middle East</h4>
          <p>
            For the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, business class on partners like Etihad or Qatar Airways is
            about 70,000 miles one-way, with first class around 100,000. Qatar&apos;s Qsuite, booked this way, is one of
            the marquee redemptions in the whole hobby, an outstanding business cabin for the price of points plus taxes
            that are often under fifty dollars. Nonstop Qsuite space out of the US can be scarce unless you book close to
            when the schedule opens, but itineraries that pair a domestic American flight with the long-haul partner leg
            tend to show up more readily at the same rate. One important timing catch with Etihad specifically: it
            typically releases premium partner award space only within about 30 days of departure, so if you want to lock
            in an Etihad seat further ahead, that usually means booking with Etihad Guest miles rather than AAdvantage.
          </p>

          <h4>Other premium-cabin partners</h4>
          <p>
            The same logic extends to other oneworld partners that go easy on surcharges, including Cathay Pacific to
            Hong Kong and Royal Air Maroc through Casablanca. The exact mile level depends on which region the chart
            places your destination in, and the farther Asia zones price a little above Japan, so confirm the live
            figure rather than assuming. The principle holds: a strong premium cabin on a surcharge-light partner is
            where big AAdvantage redemptions earn their keep.
          </p>

          {/* SEARCH */}
          <div id="search" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>How do you find and book partner space?</div>
          <p>
            Most oneworld partner awards can be searched and booked right on aa.com, which is a big part of what makes
            AAdvantage pleasant to use. British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines,
            Qantas, Royal Air Maroc and others generally show up in the standard award search when space exists. Set the
            site to one passenger, search one-way, and watch for the fixed partner price rather than the floating
            American number.
          </p>
          <p>
            The notable exception is Etihad, which is not a oneworld member. Etihad partner space often does not appear
            online and usually has to be booked by calling American. Etihad also typically releases premium partner award
            space only within about 30 days of departure, so if your trip is further out, an Etihad seat usually has to be
            booked with Etihad Guest miles instead. A few other partners can be hit or miss on the site too, so if you can
            see the seats on a third-party award search but aa.com will not let you book them, a phone call to AAdvantage
            is the fallback. Have the exact flights and dates ready before you call.
          </p>
          <div className="cd-note">
            <div className="cap">Check the price tag, not just the seat</div>
            <p style={{ margin: 0 }} className="sub">
              When a partner award appears, confirm the miles match the fixed chart and glance at the cash line beside
              them. A low, steady mile count with small taxes is the partner chart doing its job. A high, fare-linked
              number means you are looking at American&apos;s own dynamic pricing instead.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* FEES */}
          <div id="fees" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>What will taxes and surcharges cost?</div>
          <p>
            One of the best things about AAdvantage is that it does not pass along carrier-imposed fuel surcharges on
            most partner awards. On programs that do, those surcharges can add hundreds of dollars each way and quietly
            wreck the value. With AAdvantage you generally pay only genuine taxes and airport fees, which on a route like
            the US to Doha can be under fifty dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one clear exception to keep in mind. American does pass surcharges through on British Airways and
            Iberia flights, and on British Airways long-haul in particular those fees can run well past several hundred
            dollars each way. The fix is simple: book the same award on a different partner where you can. If a British
            Airways award shows an ugly cash total next to the miles, price the route on Finnair, Iberia metal that
            avoids the worst of it, or another carrier before you confirm.
          </p>

          {/* EXAMPLE */}
          <div id="example" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>A worked example, tying it back to Avion</div>
          <p>
            Here is why the transfer from the companion guide can be worth it, despite the haircut. RBC Avion moves to
            AAdvantage at roughly 1 Avion to 0.7 miles, so it takes about 100,000 Avion points to land 70,000 AAdvantage
            miles. That ratio means you only want to use these miles on high-value redemptions, never on a cheap economy
            seat you could have bought outright.
          </p>
          <div className="cd-note">
            <div className="cap">The math on a Qsuite</div>
            <p style={{ margin: 0 }} className="sub">
              Those 70,000 miles book one-way Qatar Qsuite business class from the US toward Doha, a cabin that often
              sells for three to four thousand dollars or more in cash, with taxes frequently under fifty dollars. So
              roughly 100,000 Avion points, after the haircut, turn into a flight worth several thousand dollars. That is
              the kind of redemption that justifies the transfer. Spend the same miles on a $400 economy hop and the
              haircut would have made it a poor trade.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The lesson is the one that runs through all of these guides. Transfer with a specific premium-cabin target in
            mind, confirm the seat exists first, and let the size of the cash fare you are avoiding justify the points you
            are spending.
          </p>

          {/* CAVEATS */}
          <div id="caveats" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>Honest caveats</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Partner space can be genuinely tough.</strong> The chart prices are wonderful, but the seats are limited and the best ones get taken. Flexibility on dates and routing is the difference between booking and waiting.</li>
            <li><strong>American metal is dynamically priced.</strong> Awards on American&apos;s own flights float with the cash fare and can be poor value. The fixed-chart magic only applies to partners.</li>
            <li><strong>Devaluations happen with little notice.</strong> AAdvantage has held its partner chart steady for a long time, but no program guarantees that forever, and changes can land overnight. Do not hoard miles indefinitely waiting for the perfect trip.</li>
            <li><strong>The Avion haircut is real.</strong> At about 1 to 0.7, transferred Avion points are worth chasing only for redemptions that return strong cents-per-point, which in practice means premium cabins on surcharge-light partners.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfers are one-way.</strong> Once Avion points become AAdvantage miles they cannot be reversed, so only move what you have a real plan to use, ideally after you have already found the seat.</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="cd-sec">The short version</div>
          <p>
            AAdvantage rewards you for ignoring American&apos;s own dynamic prices and pointing your miles at the fixed
            partner chart instead. Business class to Europe around 57,500, Japan Airlines around 60,000, and Qatar Qsuite
            or Etihad business around 70,000 are the redemptions worth chasing, all with low surcharges as long as you
            steer clear of British Airways and Iberia metal. Feed the balance with Avion when a high-value seat is in
            your sights, confirm the live price every time, and these miles do real work.
