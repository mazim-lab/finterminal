const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "What is the Amex MR to Aeroplan transfer ratio?",
    a: "Membership Rewards points transfer to Aeroplan at 1 to 1, so 30,000 Amex points become 30,000 Aeroplan points. Points move in set increments such as 100 or 1,000 depending on your card.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does an Amex MR transfer to Aeroplan take?",
    a: "Transfers are usually quick. The points often appear in Aeroplan within minutes, though it can occasionally take up to 24 hours. Because of that, you should confirm your award seat before you move the points.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I transfer Aeroplan points back to Amex Membership Rewards?",
    a: "No. The transfer only goes one way. Once your points land in Aeroplan they cannot come back to Amex, which is why you should transfer with a plan rather than on a whim.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which Amex cards can transfer to Aeroplan?",
    a: "You need an Amex card that earns full Membership Rewards points and includes airline transfer partners. In Canada the common ones are the Cobalt Card, the Gold Rewards Card, The Platinum Card, the Business Platinum Card, and the Business Gold Rewards Card. Confirm your specific card lists Aeroplan as a partner in your online account.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I wait for an Amex transfer bonus to Aeroplan?",
    a: "Only if you already know you will use the points. Amex occasionally runs limited-time promotions that add a bonus of roughly 25 to 35 percent when you move points to Aeroplan. That is a good reason to transfer a little early for a trip you have planned, but a bonus is not a deal if you were not going to use the points.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many points should I transfer to Aeroplan?",
    a: "Transfer only what your booking needs, plus a small buffer if you like. Over-transferring leaves stranded points sitting in Aeroplan with no plan, and those points can no longer be used with other partners.",
  },

            Amex Membership Rewards points are flexible, and one of their best uses for Canadians is moving them
            to Air Canada Aeroplan, where they can buy flights worth far more than a cash-back equivalent. The
            transfer itself takes about two minutes once you know where to click. The skill is in the timing,
            which is what most of this guide is about.

            <p style={{ margin: 0 }} className="sub">
              Amex Membership Rewards points transfer to Air Canada Aeroplan at a 1 to 1 ratio, so 30,000 MR
              points become 30,000 Aeroplan points, usually within minutes. The transfer only goes one way and
              cannot be reversed, so confirm your award seat first and move only what you need. The best time to
              transfer is right before you book, or during an Amex transfer bonus of roughly 25 to 35 percent if
              you already have a trip planned.

          {/* BASICS */}
          <div id="basics" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>What ratio does MR transfer to Aeroplan?</div>
          <p>
            Membership Rewards points transfer to Aeroplan at a 1 to 1 ratio, so 30,000 Amex points become
            30,000 Aeroplan points. Transfers are usually quick, often instant and occasionally up to a day, and
            they move in set increments such as 100 or 1,000 points depending on the card.
          </p>
          <p>
            The single most important thing to understand is that the transfer only goes one way. Once your
            points land in Aeroplan they cannot come back to Amex. That is not a problem at all, it just means
            you transfer with a plan, not on a whim.
          </p>

          {/* CARDS */}
          <div id="cards" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>Which cards qualify?</div>
          <p>
            You need an Amex card that earns full Membership Rewards points and includes airline transfer
            partners. In Canada the common ones are below.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>American Express Cobalt Card</strong>, a favourite for its strong earn on dining and groceries.</li>
            <li><strong>American Express Gold Rewards Card</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>The Platinum Card</strong> and <strong>Business Platinum Card</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Gold Rewards Card</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="cd-note">
            <div className="cap">Worth checking</div>
            Not every Amex points program transfers to airline partners, and a few entry-level cards earn a
            different flavour of points with fewer options. Before you count on a transfer, confirm your specific
            card lists Aeroplan as a partner in your online account. You can compare the earning cards in our

            </div>
          </div>

          {/* TIMING */}
          <div id="timing" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>When should you transfer?</div>
          <p>
            The best transfer is one that happens right before you book, against a confirmed award seat. The
            second-best moment is during a transfer bonus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every so often Amex runs a limited-time promotion that adds a bonus when you move points to Aeroplan,
            often somewhere in the range of 25 to 35 percent extra. If you already know you will need Aeroplan
            points for a trip in the near future, a transfer bonus is a genuinely good reason to move them a
            little early. Just be honest with yourself that you will use them, because once they are in Aeroplan
            they are committed.
          </p>
          <div className="cd-note">
            <div className="cap">Tip</div>
            Keep your points in Membership Rewards until you have a use for them. MR points can go to several
            partners, so holding them keeps your options open. Aeroplan points can only be Aeroplan points.

          {/* MISTAKES */}
          <div id="mistakes" className="cd-sec" style={{ scrollMarginTop: 70 }}>What mistakes should you avoid?</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Transferring before confirming award space.</strong> Always find the seat first. Moving points and then discovering the flight is gone is the classic regret.</li>
            <li><strong>Over-transferring.</strong> Send what you need. Stranded points sitting in Aeroplan with no plan are points you can no longer use elsewhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Name mismatches.</strong> Your name on Amex and Aeroplan should match. A typo can hold up the transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Chasing a bonus with no plan.</strong> A transfer bonus is only a deal if you were going to use the points. Otherwise it is just locking points into one program early.</li>
          </ul>
