# FinTerminal — Update Runbook (for scheduled cron agents)

This document tells an automated agent (or a human) exactly how to refresh each
section of the site. It is self-contained: a cloud cron agent that has cloned this
repo should be able to follow any job below without prior context.

## 0. Ground rules (read first, every job)

- **Voice.** All written copy (deals, news, guides, theses) follows the house voice:
  human, warm, like an experienced churner-and-father — knowledgeable but mindful of
  people's finances; clarity with a sprinkle of kindness; overall positive. **No em
  dashes. No AI cadence (no staccato three-word clauses).**
- **Privacy / public repo.** This repo is (or will be) public on GitHub. **Never commit
  personal financial data.** The portfolio commits **percentages only** — never dollar
  amounts, share counts, account balances, or option strikes. Personal CSVs live in
  `private/` (gitignored). Verify with `git check-ignore private/` before any commit.
- **Sourcing & attribution.** Deals link **straight to the merchant** and never credit
  RedFlagDeals. News credits PoT / OMAAT / DoC **only** for genuine exclusives/scoops;
  public info (offer changes, airline news) is written as our own reporting. Do not
  mention competitor sites anywhere else on the site.
- **Verify before publishing.** Do not write a number, bonus, fee, or deal from memory.
  Confirm it against a real source (issuer page, merchant page, brokerage snapshot).
  If you cannot confirm, mark it UNSURE and leave the stored value rather than guess.
- **Build / dev gotchas.**
  - OneDrive locks `.next`: run `rm -rf .next` before any `npm run build`.
  - **Never** run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is live (it corrupts the dev
    server's `.next`). Validate JSON with a quick `python -c "import json; json.load(open(...))"`
    instead of a full build when the dev server is running.
  - After data edits, the dev server hot-reloads JSON imports automatically.
- **Cost.** Use the user's Claude Max plan, not API credits.

### Cron feasibility (important)

| Job | Cadence | Cloud-cron friendly? | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deals | daily ~2am | **Yes** | RedFlagDeals is fetchable without a logged-in browser |
| News | daily/weekly | **Yes** | WebSearch/WebFetch only |
| Card data refresh | quarterly | **Partial** | Issuer pages bot-block `WebFetch`; need the residential/Playwright fetch or the real browser to (re)capture `data/raw/cards/*.md`. The *audit/extraction* over already-captured `.md` files IS cloud-friendly. |
| Portfolio | twice weekly | **No — stays manual** | Needs the user's private Wealthsimple CSVs + all-time return %. A cloud cron has no access to these. Keep manual. |

### How to ship a change (every job ends here)

- **Repo:** `github.com/mazim-lab/churningcanada`. The working tree **is** a git repo with
  a GitHub remote — **ignore the harness env banner if it says "Is a git repository:
  false", that banner is wrong.** `private/` is gitignored (verified with `git check-ignore`).
- **Active branch:** `redesign-moneyatlas` (the in-progress redesign; not yet merged to
  `main` as of 2026-06-21). Deploy is on **Vercel**, configured in the Vercel dashboard
  (there is no `vercel.json` in-repo).
- **Prerequisites a runner needs:** `python` and Node/`npm` on PATH. The card-page
  recapture step (§3c) needs a real browser (claude-in-chrome) or the Playwright pipeline
  — **a cloud cron has neither**, and issuer pages bot-block `WebFetch`. If a refresh needs
  new `.md` captures, the cron should STOP and open a task for the user rather than fetch
  with WebFetch.

To ship a data update:
1. Edit on the working branch — **do not commit straight to `main`.** For an isolated
   automated change, branch off first: `git checkout -b cron/deals-YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. Stage only intended files (e.g. `git add src/data/deals.ts`). **Never `git add private/`.**
3. Commit with a clear message; push: `git push -u origin <branch>`.
4. Vercel auto-redeploys on push to its configured branch. **Confirm with the user which
   branch Vercel deploys to production before relying on unattended push-to-deploy** —
   the site is currently mid-redesign on `redesign-moneyatlas`, not `main`.
5. Roll back a bad data push with `git revert <sha>` then push. **Never force-push a
   shared branch.**

## 1. DEALS — daily (target 2am America/Toronto)

**File:** `src/data/deals.ts` (a `Deal[]`). **Page:** `src/app/deals/page.tsx`.

**Scope (do not drift):** real **product/service** deals that save people money — a
quality item at a deep discount, OR a productive buy that pays for itself over time
(robot vacuum, coffee grinder, water filters, headphones, home improvement). **NOT
credit-card or bank welcome offers** — those belong in the Cards tab.

**Source:** `https://forums.redflagdeals.com/hot-deals-f9/` — scan the thread list and
the "Trending Hot Deals" box. Favour high-engagement, on-theme items.

**Steps:**
1. Open the Hot Deals forum. Identify 3 (default) on-scope product/service deals — high
   upvotes/replies and genuine value.
2. **Open each thread and VERIFY** price, terms, and expiry. Do not trust the title alone.
   (We were once burned by posting plausible-but-unverified placeholder deals — never again.)
3. Pull the **clean merchant product URL** from the thread's "Deal Link" / "Get This
   Deal". **Strip RFD affiliate redirects** (`*.o93x.net`, `amzn.to`, `go.redirectingat.com`)
   down to the bare `bestbuy.ca/.../<id>` or `amazon.ca/dp/<ASIN>`.
4. Write each as a `Deal`:
   ```ts
   { title, merchant, url /* DIRECT, never RFD */, price, was /* struck-through reg price */,
     blurb /* house voice, include one honest caveat if the deal has a catch */,
     category, posted /* "Mon D, YYYY" */, expires? /* human label */, expiresAt? /* "YYYY-MM-DD" */ }
   ```
5. **Add new deals to the top.** Set `expiresAt` (ISO date) on anything time-limited.
6. The page **auto-archives** expired deals: it splits into "Today's picks" vs a
   collapsible "Archive" by comparing `expiresAt` to today (America/Toronto). A deal
   stays live through its whole end date and moves to Archive the next day. The page
   uses `export const revalidate = 3600`, so this happens hourly with **no redeploy**.
   Old deals self-archive — you only add new ones and occasionally prune the archive.
7. Commit & push.

**Cloud note:** a cron agent fetches RFD via WebFetch/WebSearch (works). It cannot drive
the local Chrome, so it should read thread text via fetch, not the browser extension.

---

## 2. NEWS — daily or weekly

**File:** `src/data/news.ts` (a `NewsItem[]`). **Page:** `src/app/news/page.tsx`.

**Steps:**
1. Gather 5 recent, **Canada-first** items via WebSearch (cards/points/travel/personal
   finance relevant to Canadians).
2. For each, set `exclusive: [...]` (crediting PoT/OMAAT/DoC by name) **only** if the
   story is genuinely exclusive to that outlet. Otherwise write it as our own reporting
   with `sourceLabel` = the issuer/airline.
3. Keep the typewriter ticker fed from the same array.
4. House voice. Commit & push.

---

## 3. CARD DATA REFRESH — quarterly-ish

Two data files: `src/data/canadian_cards_comprehensive.json` (CA, 131 cards) and
`src/data/us_cards_comprehensive.json` (US, 63 cards). Normalization + display logic is
in `src/data/cards.ts`; point valuations in `src/data/point-valuations.ts`.

**Golden source per card (use these, NOT the raw scraper dicts):**
- **CA cards:** `data/raw/cards/<slug>.md` — real issuer pages (markitdown; image-heavy,
  so `grep` for "earn"/"cash back"/"points"/"%"/"fee"/"welcome").
- **US Amex cards:** `data/raw/md/american-express-us.md` (one big file with every US Amex
  card). The 23 US-Amex files in `scrapers/detail_cache/` are all an identical
  **22047-byte Amex login-wall page — junk, ignore them.**
- **US Chase/other:** `scrapers/detail_cache/<slug>.txt` (real pages for non-Amex).
- **`scrapers/detail_cache/*.txt` has many junk duplicate files** (identical md5/size
  across unrelated cards). Always prefer the `.md` source for CA. Detect dupes by
  grouping files on size/md5 before trusting them.

### 3a. Welcome bonuses, annual fees, FX fee, features

Pattern (proven 2026-06-21): **fan out ~11 auditor agents**, ~12 cards each. Each agent
gets a batch file with the stored values + the card's `md_source`, and verifies:

- **annual_fee** (CAD, primary cardholder's ongoing fee).
- **welcome_bonus** — text + `welcome_bonus_points` (point count for points cards, `null`
  for cash/no-bonus cards) + `welcome_bonus_value_cad`. **Run an internal-consistency
  check:** the text must agree with points and value (a "$100 cash back" card must not
  carry `points: 120`; a cash-back card must not have a points value). This is the exact
  class of bug that started the last audit (Tangerine).
- **foreign_transaction_fee** — `true` (charges, usually 2.5%) or `false` (FX-free).
  **Also set `foreign_transaction_fee_pct: 2.5`** on cards that charge it, or the detail
  page renders "—" instead of "2.5%" (the boolean alone is not enough). Known FX-free CA
  cards: Scotia Passport Visa Infinite (regular/Privilege/Business), Scotia Gold Amex,
  Wealthsimple, and the USD-billed TD/RBC/Scotia U.S.-Dollar cards. **Rogers charges FX
  then rebates** → `true`.
- **features/key_perks** — flag fabricated perks (lounge/hotel-elite/concierge on cards
  that don't have them) and benefit-flag contamination from a wrong cache.

**Source priority:** the `md` first (issuer's own page); if the exact welcome bonus is on
a linked offer page not in the `md`, do ONE targeted WebSearch (`"<card> welcome bonus
2026 canada"`) and trust the **issuer page over aggregators** (Milesopedia etc. lag).

**Apply with QC judgment, not blindly:**
- Apply md/issuer-confirmed fixes (fees, FX, internal-consistency, fabricated-perk removal).
- **Hold** risky web-only "offer changed" bumps (promo periods) and re-verify with 1–2
  independent agents before applying.
- Watch for **wrong/sibling cached pages** (a card's `md` showing a different card). When
  found, the card's `apply_url` is usually also wrong (a user-facing bug — the Apply
  button links to the wrong card). Re-pull the correct page (see 3c) and fix `apply_url`.

### 3b. Earn rates

US logic lives in `parseUsEarnRates` (in `cards.ts`); CA earn rates parse in
`normalizeCA` with a **safety quality-gate filter** (drops category keys >40 chars / >7
words or junk patterns like "Go to note", "à la carte", "purchasesGo", and non-clean
rates). Keep that gate — it stops shared-cache contamination from ever rendering.

To (re)extract earn rates: **fan out ~11 agents** over the golden sources. Each card →
array of `{category, rate}`:
- Rate format: points/miles multipliers as `"Nx"` (e.g. `"5x"` = 5 pts/$1, `"1.25x"`,
  "1 pt per $1.50" → `"0.67x"`); cash back as `"N%"` (e.g. `"4%"`, `"0.5%"`).
- Category: SHORT and clean, **≤40 chars and ≤7 words** (or the gate drops it). No
  sentence fragments.
- Always include the base "All other purchases" rate.
- **THE #1 TRAP — use the CARD'S OWN multiplier, NOT the inflated "up to Nx total"** that
  bundles airline/hotel/elite/member earning. Examples that bit us: United "7x total" is
  2x card + 5x MileagePlus → store **2x**; IHG "26x" ≈ 10x card; Hyatt "9x" → 4x card;
  Marriott "14–18x" → the 3x/6x card portion; WestJet "up to 6x" bundles Silver status.
- Exclude welcome bonuses, intro/BT rates, APR, fees, partner cross-sell ads.
- Low-interest / no-reward cards get an empty `{}` (they correctly show "no earn-rate data").

Store as a `{category: rate}` dict on each card's `earn_rates`. Merge, then validate:
**0 gate violations, 0 junk keys.**

### 3c. Re-capturing a wrong/stale `.md` page

Issuer sites (esp. RBC) **bot-block `WebFetch`** (returns an empty shell). Options:
- Use the real **claude-in-chrome browser** (local session): navigate to the correct
  official product URL, `get_page_text`, write to `data/raw/cards/<slug>.md`. Watch for
  **301 redirects** — a redirect to a different card's page means the card is
  **discontinued** (e.g. `rbc-rateadvantage-visa` now redirects to RBC Visa Classic Low
  Rate → it was removed as a duplicate).
- Or re-run the original residential Playwright + markitdown pipeline (see
  [[churningcanada-project]] memory for the full pipeline).
- Confirm the fetched page is the RIGHT card (name/fee/bonus match, not a sibling) before
  overwriting. Fix the card's `apply_url` to the correct URL at the same time.

### 3d. Point valuations

`src/data/point-valuations.ts` maps each program → `{ baseline, max }` cents-per-point.
The CA bonus value displayed = `points × baseline / 100`, so a wrong cpp inflates every
card on that program. Sanity-check after any change (e.g. **PC Optimum = 0.1¢**, 1,000
pts = $1 — it was wrongly 0.7¢ and inflated PC cards 7×).

### 3e. Card-data validation checklist (run after any refresh)

1. JSON valid: `python -c "import json; json.load(open('src/data/canadian_cards_comprehensive.json',encoding='utf-8'))"` (and the US file).
2. No card showing a round 5,000/10,000 "points" that's actually a `$` spend threshold.
3. No cash-back card mislabeled with a points `rewards_program` or a points welcome value.
4. Earn rates: 0 categories >40 chars; 0 junk/fragment keys; no card sharing a
   byte-identical earn-rate blob with an unrelated card (contamination tell).
5. FX: every card has `foreign_transaction_fee` set (not null); chargers have `_pct: 2.5`.
6. Spot-check 5–10 flagship cards on the live detail pages.
7. Run an **independent audit pass** (a second wave of agents that re-derive truth from
   source and diff against stored) for anything high-stakes.

## 4. PORTFOLIO — twice weekly (MANUAL, not a cron)

Documented in full in the `finterminal-update-playbook` memory. Summary: positions are
mostly long-dated **options (LEAPS)** that free price APIs don't quote, so values come
from the user's Wealthsimple, not an API. The user provides into `private/` (gitignored):
`holdings-report-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, the full `activities-export-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, and the
Wealthsimple **all-time return %** per account. Scripts in `private/`
(`compute_holdings.py`, `by_ticker.py`, `analyze.py`, `timeseries.py`) produce the
per-underlying return/weight, top profit/loss, closed positions, and history. Write
**percentages only** into `src/data/portfolio.ts`. **A cloud cron cannot do this** (no
access to the private brokerage data) — keep it a manual, user-initiated update.
